== Description ==

The Admin dashboard in WP 2.7 has a neat Recent Comments Box, from which you can manage and reply to comments directly. The only problem is that it shows the comment excerpt instead of the entire comment text. This means that you basically have to load another page to view the entire comment.

This simple plugin fixes this issue.

== Installation ==

The plugin can be installed in 2 easy steps:

1. Unzip "Custom Field Images" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.
1. Enjoy. :)
